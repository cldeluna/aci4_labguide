# Export Tech Support

While ACI is now a mature technology, there are occaisions when you will need to contact Cisco TAC for support.  Its always a good idea to have your current configuration documented and ACI makes that very simple.  

In Lab 07, we configured a remote location for daily backups and off-fabric snapshots.  We will use thei same remote FTP server to export what is the equivalent of show tech.
