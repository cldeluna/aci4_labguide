Lab Access \u00b6 Each student is assigned their own lab \"Pod\" (Tenant) in the fabric. Please refer to the Student Pod Table below for your Remote Desktop (RDP) IP Address and Credentials. Access to the lab environment is via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and so you will need an RDP client on your system in order to access the lab.

IMPORTANT: Please review before continuing with the lab. \u00b6 LAB PREMISE \u00b6 This Lab has a total of 16 Pods. Some equipment is shared across all the Pods while other equipment is dedicated to each individual Pod. A Pod is a group of devices and resources which make an individual Lab usable for each student. ACI is fundamentally a multi-tenant environment and the lab environment makes full use of that capability. Each Student will create their own Tenant in their Pod and map all the policies, test servers, and equipment dedicated to the Pod to their own tenant. For example: The student assigned to POD11 will create their own POD11 tenant and configure access policies and virtual networking policies to the POD11 tenant. A naming standard is particularly important in an ACI Design. All policies will follow a naming standard based on your POD number. Common Equipment \u00b6 The table below details the shared equipment in the lab. This equipment will be shared by all students.
