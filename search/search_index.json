A leaf, spine, or apic is a \"Node\" in your ACI fabric and the node numbering is important. In our lab we have a Nexus 9336 Spine, two Nexus 9396 Leafs, and a single APIC-Server-M1. Hardware Overview \u00b6 Model Name View Information N9K-C9336PQ Spine-1 Hardware Overview N9K-C9372PX-E LEAF-1 Hardware Overview N9K-C9372PX-E LEAF-2 Hardware Overview APIC-SERVER-M1 apic1 This configuration is perfectly valid for a Lab but it is not valid for a production environment. The minimum physical fabric hardware for a production environment includes two spines, two leafs, and three APICs. Fabric Turn Up \u00b6 It is important to know that the initial turn up and device discovery and registration has already ocurred. You are accessing the lab after this step has been completed. A fabric turn up is typically performed on site. Physical Connectivity \u00b6 The management network is up and configured All the management interfaces of the spines and leafs are connected to the management network Optionally, all the console interfaces of the spines and leafs are connected to a terminal server Each leaf switch has a fabric uplink to each spine Each APIC has a CIMC connection to the management network a Managmenet connection to the management network Redundant 10G fabric uplinks Logical Parameters \u00b6 Paramenter Use Lab Value Pod Number Numeric identifier for each ACI Pod&lt;br&gt;Default: 1 1 TEP Pool Default: 10.0.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/16 TEP Vlan Default: None Management Subnet/Mask Default: 192.168.10.0/24 192.168.10.0/24 Management Network Gateway Default: None 192.168.10.1/24 2019 Melbourne Cisco Live How to Setup an ACI Fabric from Scratch - BRKACI-2004 - 2019 Melbourne Cisco Live Explore the Cisco ACI GUI \u00b6 Now that you are familiar with the physical components of the Lab, lets investigate the APIC GUI and the topology from the APIC controller. Step 1 \u00b6 Connect to your Student PC. See the Getting Around section for details. Step 2 \u00b6 From your Student PC, open a browser. Google Chrome is recommended for managing the APIC. https://192.168.10.1 or https://apic.dc.local Accept the security warning or create a security exception to access the GUI with the self signed certificate. Note that Secure HTTP (https) is required to access the APIC GUI by default. Insecure HTTP (http) must be explicitly enabled and is not recommended in a production environment. Step 3 \u00b6 Login to the APIC. Note the warnings which will flash in the uppler right corner. You will see a Critical warning that the cluster does not contain 3 controllers. You may also see a Major warning regarding Licensing. This is expected in the Lab environment. Should you see these warning in a production environment, they must be corrected. You will see the \"What's New\" dialog and the main APIC Dashboard behding the dialog. Step 4 \u00b6 Skim through the What's New dialog and close it. Step 5 \u00b6 Examine the the top-most section of the GUI interface. This top ribbon containing the main functional areas of the fabric (System, Tenants, Fabric, Virtual Networking, L4-L7 Services, Admin, Operations, Apps) is known as the Menu Bar . Menu Bar \u00b6 You will use it to navigate to the area of the ACI Fabric you need to view or update. Notice the shading and highlighting to help orient you in the GUI. The Menu bar shows that we are in the Dashboard section of the System menu. ACI GUI Menu Options Menu Headings/Tabs Description System Upon login, the GUI defaults to the System Menu Dashboard which provides the health status of the system. From the System menu tab other settings and licensing options are available along with events and faults. Tenants The Tenants Menu provides access to all tenants configured in the fabric and their logical configuration objects. Fabric The Fabric Menu provides access to inventory details, Fabric Policies, and Access Policies. Virtual Networking The Virtual Networking Menu displays and configures the fabric Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs). L4-L7 Services The L4-L7 Services Menu displays and configures the fabric Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs). Admin The Admin Menu displays and configures administrative functions such as authentication, authorization, and accounting functions, scheduling policies, retaining and purging records, upgrading firmware, and controlling features such as syslog, Call Home, and SNMP. Operations The Operations Menu provides access to operational functions including:<br>- Visibility & Troubleshooting<br>- Capacity Dashboard<br>- EP Tracker<br>- Visualiztion Apps The Apps tab displays all the applications installed or uploaded to APIC. The tab allows an APIC administrator to upload, enable, upgrade, install, or uninstall a packaged application in APIC. Areas of the APIC GUI \u00b6 The APIC or controller GUI has 4 main areas: - Menu Bar - Submenu Bar - Navigation Pane - Work Pane Select the Tenants menu. You will see a list of the default or pre-defined tenants which come with ACI \"out of the box\". Select the common tenant. You will see the standard tenants options listed collapsed in the Navigation Pane on the left side. If you select an option in the Navigation Pane, the objects pertaining to that selection are shows in the Work Pane to the right of the Navigation Pane. The Work Pane displays details about the option selected in the Navigation Pane. Fabric configuration via the GUI is typically performed in the Work Pane. Step 6 \u00b6 Take some time to select each Menu Bar option and get comfortable moving around in the GUI. For the remainder of the Lab the following convention will be used to guide the Student in navigating the GUI: Menu Bar Option > Submenu Option > Navigation Pane Option(s) > Work Pane Tabs From where you are in the Tenants menu navigate to: System > Dashboard to get back to the Health Dashboard of the Fabric. Notice that when you select the * System Menu option, you will automatically go to the Dashboard by default. GUI Tips \u00b6 Wherever there is a submit button and you are trying to make a change - click it. Some changes won\u2019t require it so the inconsistency sometimes calls that into question. Refresh - sometimes your changes won\u2019t appear until you do, you will see the little circular refresh button on most screens Hover over icons with your mouse for a few seconds to view the icon description Exporing Fabric Inventory, Nodes, and Fabric Topology \u00b6 Now that there is some familiarity with the GUI, lets validate the topology of the fabric. Step 1 - View and Explore the Toplogy \u00b6 Navigate to Fabric > Inventory > Topology . The Work Pane opens into the Summary tab. To view the topology diagram, click on the Topology tab in the Work Pane. Note that the full path would be shown as: Fabric > Inventory > Topology > Topology Navigation paths like this are not uncommon in the ACI GUI. Recall that the format we will follow throughout the lab is: Menu Bar Option > Submenu Option > Navigation Pane Option(s) > Work Pane Tabs From the Topology tab in the work pan verify that the displayed topology reflects the lab design. - One Spine - Two Leaf switches - One APIC server dual-homed to both leaf switches Note: You will see the same topology view if you go to Fabric > Inventory > Pod 1 > Topology Device Summary via hover over device icon \u00b6 Hover over each device icon for a very useful physical summary of the device. Device Connectivity \u00b6 Double click each device icon to view a list of connections. Step 2 - View and Explore the Inventory \u00b6 Navigate to Fabric > Inventory > Fabric Membership . Here you will see the fabric inventory including serial number, Pod, Node ID, Model, Role, Fabric IP, and Status. The Pod, Node ID, and Role are defined during fabric discovery. You will notice that the IP comes from the TEP Pool that was provided during the apic intitial confirguration. Notice the additional tabs including Nodes Pending Registration . This tab is used to register new devices to the fabric. Double clicking on one of the device rows will display a dialog with device details. Examine each device and note the details that are available including certificate information. Skills you should have after Lab Completion \u00b6 After completing this labs you should: - be familiar with the hardware components of the lab - be familiar with the APIC GUI, its high level menu options, and how to navigate around - be able to explore the fabric inventory and determine model, status, and connectivity information - understand where to go to add new devices to the fabric","title":"Lab 01 - Fabric Discovery"},{"location":"01_lab_fabric_discovery/#lab-01-fabric-inventory-and-discovery","text":"","title":"Lab 01 - Fabric Inventory and Discovery"},{"location":"01_lab_fabric_discovery/#physical-build","text":"Its important to be familiar with the physical configuration of each node in your ACI fabric.

IMPORTANT: Please review before continuing with the lab. \u00b6 LAB PREMISE \u00b6 This Lab has a total of 16 Pods. Some equipment is shared across all the Pods while other equipment is dedicated to each individual Pod. A Pod is a group of devices and resources which make an individual Lab usable for each student. Each Pod is identified by a two digit number. Throghout your lab guide, if you see ##, replace ## with your Pod number. ACI is fundamentally a multi-tenant environment and the lab environment makes full use of that capability. Each Student will create their own Tenant in their Pod and map all the policies, test servers, and equipment dedicated to the Pod to their own tenant. For example: The student assigned to POD11 will create their own POD11 tenant and configure access policies and virtual networking policies to the POD11 tenant. A naming standard is particularly important in an ACI Design. All policies will follow a naming standard based on your POD number. Common Equipment \u00b6 The table below details the shared equipment in the lab. This equipment will be shared by all students. Because these resources are shared, you will see configuration appear that is not your own. Please do not delete or change any configuration item that is not your own. Please be respectful of the other students and use only your POD resources.
